# @microsoft/repo-templates

> Microsoft's default repo templates

# What is this?

These files are packaged as the default, standard recommended content for net new
GitHub repos created by Microsoft teams across all official Microsoft GitHub orgs such
as `microsoft`, `MicrosoftDocs`, `Azure`, etc.

This is not a GitHub repo template, however, since we have a number of different
orgs. Previous to 2020, this content was partially mirrored in the `microsoft.github.io` repo.

When Microsoft teams create new repos, either through internal tooling, or on GitHub directly,
these files are applied as sane defaults and help to encourage community.

Please help build the future of Microsoft open communities by making thoughtful contributions here.

These projects should be technology-agnostic.

## Structure of directories

### `shared` directory

The common directory contains defaults that all templates use unless overridden.

### `projections` directory

These are more specific templates for projects such as Microsoft official samples or
.NET Foundation projects.
